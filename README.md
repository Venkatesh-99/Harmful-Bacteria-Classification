# Harmful Bacteria Classification with Machine Learning
<div align="justify">
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying bacteria based on their features using various machine learning models. The notebook ('Bacteria_Classification.ipynb') analyzes a dataset ('bacteria_list_200.csv') that includes information about different bacteria, such as their name, family, habitat, and whether they are harmful to humans.

   </div>

4. Follow the notebook instructions:
    - Load and preprocess the dataset (bacteria_list_200.csv).
    - Explore data insights and visualizations, such as pie charts and heatmaps.
    - Implement machine learning models including Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, 
    - Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost.
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
    - Customize and adapt the notebook for further analysis or experimentation.

## Notes
<div align="justify">

  - Adjust parameters, hyperparameters, and model configurations in the notebook based on specific dataset characteristics and analysis goals.

  - Refer to markdown cells and comments within the notebook for detailed explanations of each step and analysis result.

  - Extend the analysis with additional visualizations, model optimizations, or new machine 
learning algorithms as needed.
